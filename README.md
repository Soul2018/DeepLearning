Mini Project: Deep Learning with Keras
In this mini-project we'll be building a deep learning classifier using Keras to predict income from the popular Adult Income dataset.

Predicting income from demographic and socio-economic information is an important task with real-world applications, such as financial planning, market research, and social policy analysis. The Adult dataset, sometimes referred to as the "Census Income" dataset, contains a vast amount of anonymized data on individuals, including features such as age, education, marital status, occupation, and more. Our objective is to leverage this data to train a deep learning model that can effectively predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 annually or not.
