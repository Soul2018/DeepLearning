Mini Project: Deep Learning with Keras
In this mini-project we'll be building a deep learning classifier using Keras to predict income from the popular Adult Income dataset.

Predicting income from demographic and socio-economic information is an important task with real-world applications, such as financial planning, market research, and social policy analysis. The Adult dataset, sometimes referred to as the "Census Income" dataset, contains a vast amount of anonymized data on individuals, including features such as age, education, marital status, occupation, and more. Our objective is to leverage this data to train a deep learning model that can effectively predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50,000 annually or not.

Throughout this Colab, we will walk you through the entire process of building a deep learning classifier using Keras, a high-level neural network API that runs on top of TensorFlow. Keras is known for its user-friendly and intuitive interface, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced deep learning practitioners.

Here's a brief outline of what we will cover in this mini-project:

Data Preprocessing: We will start by loading and exploring the Adult dataset.

Building the Deep Learning Model: We will construct a neural network using Keras, where we'll dive into understanding the key components of a neural network, including layers, activation functions, and optimization algorithms.

Model Training: With our model architecture in place, we will split the data into training and validation sets and train the neural network on the training data. We will monitor the training process to prevent overfitting and enhance generalization.

Model Evaluation: After training, we'll assess the performance of our model on the test dataset.
